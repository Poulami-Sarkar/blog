## Deliverables
1. Running the code<br .>
The source code for my work can be found [here](https://www.github.com/Poulami-Sarkar/Bengali-Hindi-OCR).
I am currently facing some issues in trying scheduling a script that submits a batch job daily. I am trying to use cron that submits a batch job everyday and runs the OCR for the new incomming files.

### Problem faced
Cron is failing to run any of the slurm commands such as sinfo, sbatch, scontrol etc. No errors are being logged so solving the issue appears to be quite challenging
